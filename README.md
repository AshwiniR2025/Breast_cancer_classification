Problem statement: We need to classify whether the particular tumour is benign or malignant tumor.Dataset is derived from fine needle aspiration test(biopsy test).Dataset contains different attributes

ID number
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) which is target
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
